# AQI Impact Analysis Project

## 📑 Project Description
This project aims to analyze the impact of displaying Air Quality Index (AQI) data in public spaces on public engagement and transportation behavior. The analysis uses synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios and includes data generation, exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Evaluate whether showing AQI data in public spaces influences public transportation choices.
- Measure public engagement through interaction with AQI displays.
